## Project Overview
The M.O.T.O.R-T (Material Operation Transport Organized Robotic-Transport) initiative is an autonomous robotic system designed to streamline material transportation and processing in foundry environments. The robot navigates along metallic tracks to transport items between distinct processing zones, integrating advanced sensing and automation capabilities.
